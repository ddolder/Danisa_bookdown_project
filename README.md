## The Nutrients - Chlorophyll-a Relationship in Utah Lake, Utah

Utah Lake (UL) is a body of fresh water used for irrigation, recreation, and potable water supply. The first pioneer settlements that found the necessary water resources to live in this arid area produced a change in land use, impacting aquatic ecosystems. Increased pollution due to algal blooms is a problem in UL. In search of a solution, the Utah Department of Water Quality (DWQ) has been working in water quality data collection. In this project, I analyzed if there is a relationship between all these parameters and the algal bloom, measured by the chlorophyll-a.
